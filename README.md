## üìå Background & Overview  
#### üéØ Situation

The e-wallet company is operating multiple products and transaction types: **Bank Transfer**, **Withdraw Money**, **Top Up Money**, **Payment Transaction**, **Transfer Money**, and **Split Bill**.

#### üìÇ Complication / Business Questions
The current status of payments and transactions is unclear, making it difficult to evaluate performance and support decision-making:

‚úîÔ∏è **Product/Team**: Which products contribute the most? Which team performs the weakest? Are there any ownership violations?

‚úîÔ∏è **Refund**: Which source_id contributes the most to refunds?

‚úîÔ∏è **Transaction**: Is the data clean? Which transaction types are most common, and what are their volumes and user counts?

#### üë§ Who is this project for?

‚úîÔ∏è Data Analysts & BI specialists in fintech/e-wallet companies

‚úîÔ∏è Payment operations & product teams

‚úîÔ∏è Decision-makers designing customer experience & fraud detection initiatives

#### 3Ô∏è.3. Data wrangling

#### ***3.3.1 Top 3 Products by Volume***
**Purpose:** Identify which products generate the highest payment volume.  This helps prioritize operational focus, marketing resources
**Code**:
<img width="911" height="148" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ec60406-dbad-4cbc-b595-36e840596da0" />

**Answer:**  Top 3 Products is 1976, 429, 372.
**Insight:**  
- We found that only **3 products** (IDs: 1976, 429, 372) make up the **majority of total payment volume**.
  
- In other words, almost all the money comes from just a few products.
  
- üëâ Why this matters: If one of these products has a problem (system error, fraud, downtime), the company could lose a lot of money quickly.
   
- ‚úÖ What to do: Keep these products running smoothly, monitor them daily, and maybe create backup plans.

---

#### ***3.3.2 Ownership Rule Check***
**Purpose:** Verify that each product is owned by exactly one team. This ensures accountability, avoids duplicated responsibility, and makes performance evaluation transparent.

**Code:** 
<img width="751" height="198" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e59bf5be-8ed9-4251-a222-a31b42bbe7b2" />

**Answer:** As all product is own by only one team => No violations  
**Insight:** All products comply, ensuring accountability and easy tracking.  

---

#### ***3.3.3 Lowest Performing Team***
**Purpose:** Detect which team contributes the least to transaction volume. This highlights where management may need to allocate support, training, or process improvements.

**Code:** 
<img width="1405" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f612104f-a377-40db-bcdd-41400471a317" />

**Answer:**  
- Team: APS  
- Lowest category contribution: 25,232,438  

**Insight:**   
- Since Q2 2023, the **APS team has the lowest performance** (they generate the least payment volume).  
- üëâ Why this matters: This could mean their products are not popular, not marketed well, or they have internal issues.  
- ‚úÖ What to do: Review APS team‚Äôs products. Maybe give them more resources, training, or marketing support.  

---

#### ***3.3.4 Refund Analysis***
**Purpose:** Understand refund sources for risk/fraud monitoring  

**Code:**
<img width="869" height="201" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9bcc1f2b-6777-416c-98cf-cb08a7a5dadc" />

**Answer:** Source_id = 38  

**Insight:** 
- We saw that **source_id = 38** is responsible for most of the **refund transactions**.  
- üëâ Why this matters: Too many refunds can mean fraud, unhappy customers, or system bugs. If we don‚Äôt fix it, trust in the wallet can drop.  
- ‚úÖ What to do: Investigate source 38 in detail. Check if it‚Äôs a risky merchant, a system issue, or a process problem.  


---

#### ***3.3.5 Transaction Classification***
**Rules:**  
- `transType=2 & merchant_id=1205` ‚Üí Bank Transfer  
- `transType=2 & merchant_id=2260` ‚Üí Withdraw Money  
- `transType=2 & merchant_id=2270` ‚Üí Top Up Money  
- `transType=2 & others` ‚Üí Payment Transaction  
- `transType=8 & merchant_id=2250` ‚Üí Transfer Money  
- `transType=8 & others` ‚Üí Split Bill  
- Else ‚Üí Invalid
- 
**Purpose:** Standardize transaction types. This allows for consistent reporting, easier aggregation, and better understanding of user behaviors.
  
**Code:**
<img width="1072" height="722" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd8a9624-5481-4518-9622-290e9bf1d001" />

**Insight:** 
- We created rules to classify each transaction into categories: **Top Up, Payment, Withdraw, Bank Transfer, Transfer Money, Split Bill, or Invalid**.  
- üëâ Why this matters: Before, it was messy and hard to analyze. Now we can group and compare transaction types easily.  
- ‚úÖ What to do: Automate these rules so every new transaction is classified correctly in real time.  


---

#### ***3.3.6 Transaction Type Summary***
**Purpose:** Measure how different transaction types contribute to overall system usage  

**Code**: 
<img width="1163" height="401" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac843c32-dbd4-41ab-90d4-f3eea045bb65" />

**Insight:**  
- **Top Up Money** and **Payments** are the biggest activities ‚Üí these are the **core services** people use daily.  
- **Transfer Money** is also strong ‚Üí shows people send money to each other often.  
- **Split Bill** is small ‚Üí not many people use it, but it‚Äôs a **unique social feature** that could grow.  
- **Withdraw / Bank Transfer** are smaller in number, but they usually involve **bigger amounts of money**.  

üëâ Why this matters:  
- The company‚Äôs strength is in **Top Up + Payment** ‚Üí focus on growing these.  
- **Transfer** shows trust in the wallet for P2P.  
- **Split Bill** could be a niche feature to promote.  
- **Withdraw / Bank Transfer** affect liquidity, so they need careful monitoring.  

## üéØ Conclusion
This analysis of e-wallet payments and transactions provides the following key insights:

### Top Products Drive Most Value
## ‚úÖ The Big Picture
- The wallet makes most of its money from a **few key products and services**.  
- Ownership is well-structured (good), but one team (**APS**) is falling behind (bad).  
- Refunds are heavily concentrated in **one source (38)**, which could be a risk.  
- Customers mainly use the wallet for **Top Up and Payments**, but also use it to **transfer money** and sometimes **split bills**.  

üëâ To improve the business:  
1. **Protect the top products** ‚Äì keep them running perfectly.  
2. **Fix refund issues** ‚Äì start with source 38.  
3. **Support APS team** ‚Äì help them improve their performance.  
4. **Grow usage** ‚Äì focus on core services and test growth ideas for Split Bill.
