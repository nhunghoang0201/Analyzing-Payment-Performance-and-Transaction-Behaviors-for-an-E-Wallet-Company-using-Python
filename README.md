#### 3Ô∏è.3. Data wrangling
| # | Business Question | Purpose | Answer | Analysis / Insight |
|---|---------|---------|--------|------------------|
| 3.3.1 | Which **3 product_ids** have the highest payment volume? | Identify top-performing products by revenue | 1976: 61,797,583,647<br>429: 14,667,676,567<br>372: 13,713,658,515 | These products generate the majority of payment volume. Focus on their operational efficiency and monitoring. |
| 3.3.2 | Are there any products that are **owned by multiple teams**? | Ensure **1 product ‚Üí 1 team** rule is maintained | No | All products comply with ownership rules, ensuring accountability and simplifying performance tracking. |
| 3.3.3 | Which **team has the lowest performance** since Q2 2023? Which category contributes least to that team? | Identify underperforming teams and weak product categories for targeted improvement | Team: APS<br>Lowest contributing category: 25,232,438 | APS team may need operational support or process improvement. Focus on the low-contributing category to boost overall performance. |
| 3.3.4 | Among **refund transactions**, which **source_id** contributes the most? | Understand refund sources for risk/fraud monitoring | Source_id: 38 | This source accounts for the highest refund volume. Recommend investigating patterns and potential operational bottlenecks. |
| 3.3.5 | How to **classify transaction types** based on `transType` and `merchant_id`? | Standardize transaction types for downstream analysis | Rules:<br>- transType=2 & merchant_id=1205 ‚Üí Bank Transfer Transaction<br>- transType=2 & merchant_id=2260 ‚Üí Withdraw Money Transaction<br>- transType=2 & merchant_id=2270 ‚Üí Top Up Money Transaction<br>- transType=2 & others ‚Üí Payment Transaction<br>- transType=8 & merchant_id=2250 ‚Üí Transfer Money Transaction<br>- transType=8 & others ‚Üí Split Bill Transaction<br>- Remaining ‚Üí Invalid | Classification enables aggregation by type, facilitating analysis of customer behavior and operational performance. |
| 3.3.6 | For each transaction type (excluding invalids), what are **total transactions, volume, senders, and receivers**? | Measure activity and revenue contribution per transaction type | **Bank Transfer Transaction:** 14,004 tx, 10,061,351,762 volume, 9,271 senders/receivers<br>**Payment Transaction:** 260,335 tx, 34,385,618,147 volume, 113,298 receivers, 102,995 senders<br>**Split Bill Transaction:** 1,376 tx, 4,901,464 volume, 572 receivers, 1,323 senders<br>**Top Up Money Transaction:** 290,498 tx, 108,605,618,829 volume, 110,409 senders/receivers<br>**Transfer Money Transaction:** 341,173 tx, 37,032,880,492 volume, 34,585 receivers, 39,021 senders<br>**Withdraw Money Transaction:** 33,725 tx, 23,418,181,420 volume, 24,814 senders/receivers | Top contributors in volume are **Top Up Money** and **Payment Transactions**. Split Bill transactions are few but may indicate niche usage. Bank Transfer and Withdraw are smaller in volume but may involve higher-value transfers. Understanding distribution helps product strategy and operational focus. |


## üéØ Conclusion
This analysis of e-wallet payments and transactions provides the following key insights:

- **Top-performing products:** A small number of products contribute the majority of payment volume. Monitoring these key products ensures efficient resource allocation and focus.

- **Team performance:** All products comply with the ‚Äú1 product ‚Üí 1 team‚Äù rule. The APS team shows the lowest performance since Q2 2023, with one category contributing least, highlighting areas for operational improvement.

- **Refunds:** Source_id 38 dominates refund transactions, indicating a potential area for operational attention or risk management.

- **Transaction behavior:**  
  - **Top Up Money** and **Payment transactions** account for the largest volumes.  
  - **Bank Transfer, Withdraw, and Split Bill transactions** are smaller in volume but may involve high-value or niche activity.  
  - Classifying transactions by type enables better understanding of customer behavior and team performance.

**Overall**, combining payment volume analysis, team performance assessment, and transaction-type classification provides actionable insights for:  

1. Identifying underperforming teams and product categories  
2. Vendor/product strategy optimization  
3. Refund and fraud risk monitoring  
4. Enhancing the overall customer transaction experience
